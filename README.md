# BitNest
The BitNest Cloud Storage Scheme. Maybe it is something like IPFS/Filecoin. But I am not sure whether it will be such big. I Just want to do something big now. 

# Development version 0.0.2
- Development version use TCP connection
- Development version use simple black-box test
- Development version use mDNS to find all node to connect
- Development version use Sequential Search at almost everywhere that need to use search


# TODO
- simplify mDNS return less record
- build the file exchange protocol

- change the connection way to connect random peer
- use self customed network connection rather than TCP to decrease resources pay
